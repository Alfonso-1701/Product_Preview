## My process

Started with mobile version, identifying how to have the image move to be side by side. Ended up going with grid layout having two even columns.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I started with media queries, to have the images loaded but not displayed. I believe that the media query has to be at the end though, I think it was adjusting the page as the cascade kept working its way down the code.  



### Continued development

As stated above, want to understand how the cascade effects items above and below code. Can work be undone simply by the order in the code for CSS.
